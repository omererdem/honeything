  Summary:
  TR-069 Device:1.1 Root Object Definition.  Contains definition of Device:1.1
  Root Object and Common Objects.

  Version History:
  November 2008: tr-106-1-1-0.xml, corresponds to TR-106 Amendment 1 section
                 3.4 (Common Object Definitions), section 3.5 (Inform Require-
                 ments), section 3.6 (Notification Requirements) and section 4
                 (Profile Definitions).  Contains only the differences from
                 Device:1.0.
  September 2009: tr-106-1-1-0.xml (name unchanged)
                 - removed duplicate bibrefs
                 - fixed cwmp-datamodel.xsd to be cwmp-datamodel-1-0.xsd

Note that on a factory reset of the CPE, the value of this parameter might be reset to its factory value.  If an ACS modifies the value of this parameter, it SHOULD be prepared to accommodate the situation that the original value is restored as the result of a factory reset.</description>

{{param}} is used only to set the ''phase'' of the periodic Informs.  The actual value of {{param}} can be arbitrarily far into the past or future.
For example, if {{param|PeriodicInformInterval}} is 86400 (a day) and if {{param}} is set to UTC midnight on some day (in the past, present, or future) then periodic Informs will occur every day at UTC midnight.  These MUST begin on the very next midnight, even if {{param}} refers to a day in the future.
The Unknown Time value defined in {{bibref|TR-106a1|section 3.2}} indicates that no particular time reference is specified.  That is, the CPE MAY locally choose the time reference, and is required only to adhere to the specified {{param|PeriodicInformInterval}}.
If absolute time is not available to the CPE, its periodic Inform behavior MUST be the same as if the {{param}} parameter was set to the Unknown Time value.</description>
