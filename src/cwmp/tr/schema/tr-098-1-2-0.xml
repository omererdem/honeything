  Summary:
  TR-069 InternetGatewayDevice:1.4 Root Object Definition.  Contains definition of
  InternetGatewayDevice:1.4 Root Object.

  Version History:
  March 2009: tr-098-1-2-0.xml, corresponds to TR-098 Amendment 1 sections 2.4 (Data
              Model), 2.4.1 (Inform and Notification Requirements) and 3 (Profile
              Definitions).
  September 2009: tr-098-1-2-0.xml (name unchanged)
              - fixed header information (had been cut-and-pasted from elsewhere)
              - changed WLANConfigurationNumberOfEntries to (wrong but consistent)
                LANWLANConfigurationNumberOfEntries
              - fixed 802.1Q-2004 reference to 802.1Q-2005
              - fixed cwmp-datamodel.xsd to be cwmp-datamodel-1-0.xsd

The Unknown Time value defined in {{bibref|TR-098a2|section 2.2}} indicates that no particular time reference is specified.  That is, the CPE MAY locally choose the time reference, and needs only to adhere to the specified {{param|PeriodicInformInterval}}.

        <description>This parameter is used to control throttling of active notifications sent by the CPE to the ACS.  It defines the minimum number of seconds that the CPE MUST wait since the end of the last session with the ACS before establishing a new session for the purpose of delivering an active notification.
In other words, if CPE needs to establish a new session with the ACS for the sole purpose of delivering an active notification, it MUST delay establishing such a session as needed to ensure that the minimum time since the last session completion has been met.
The time is counted since the last successfully completed session, regardless of whether or not it was used for active notifications or other purposes. However, if connection to the ACS is established for purposes other than just delivering active notifications, including for the purpose of retrying a failed session, such connection MUST NOT be delayed based on this parameter value, and the pending active notifications MUST be communicated during that connection.
The time of the last session completion does not need to be tracked across reboots.</description>

Each entry in the list MUST be either an IP address or an IP subnet specified using variable length subnet mask (VLSM) syntax.
An IP subnet is specified as an IP address followed (with no intervening white space) by "/n", where  n is an integer in the range  0-32; this is equivalent to a subnet mask consisting of n 1s followed by 32 minus n 0s.
For example, 1.2.3.4 specifies a single IP address, and 1.2.3.4/24 specifies a class C subnet with subnet mask 255.255.255.0.
The maximum length of a single entry (plus comma) is 19 characters so 10000 bytes is sufficient for more than 500 IP addresses and/or IP subnets.</description>

A value of 1 or greater indicates an Exclusive Filter, where the value 1 indicates the first entry to be considered (highest precedence).
A value of 0 indicates a Non-Exclusive Filter (OPTIONAL).
For each packet, if the packet matches any Exclusive Filters, the packet is assigned to the Bridge associated with the highest precedence Exclusive Filter to which it matches (lowest {{param}} value).
If and only if the packet does not match any Exclusive Filters, the packet is assigned to all Bridges associated with each Non-Exclusive Filter for which it matches the defining criteria.
If a packet matches no Filter, it is discarded.
When the {{param}} is set to match that of an existing Exclusive Filter (1 or greater), the value for the existing entry and all higher numbered entries is incremented (lowered in precedence) to ensure uniqueness of this value. A deletion or change in {{param}} of an Exclusive Filter causes {{param}} values of other Exclusive Filters (values 1 or greater) to be compacted.
Note that the use of Exclusive Filters to associate a layer 3 router interface with LAN and/or WAN interfaces via a Bridge entry overrides and updates the association between layer 3 and layer 2 objects implied by the ''InternetGatewayDevice'' object hierarchy.
Support for Non-Exclusive Filter entries, i.e. entries with an {{param}} value of 0, is OPTIONAL because 802.1D {{bibref|802.1D-2004}} and 802.1Q {{bibref|802.1Q-2005}} do not consider the case of a packet potentially being admitted to more than one bridge.</description>

For an 802.1Q bridge, the value of this parameter MUST NOT be 0, and it is interpreted as follows  (more than one condition can apply, e.g. a single Filter table entry might both add an interface to a VLAN's Member Set, and define a classification rule).
# If the Bridge Port table is not supported, it is a candidate to be the 802.1Q Port VLAN ID (PVID) for the interface associated with this Filter.  Where there is more than one such candidate for a given interface, the PVID MUST be selected according to the {{param|ExclusivityOrder}} precedence rules.
# The interface associated with this Filter is added to the VLAN's 802.1Q Member Set.

For an 802.1D {{bibref|802.1D-2004}} Bridge, which has no concept of VLANs, the VLAN ID MUST be 0.  This is most easily achieved by allowing this parameter to retain its default value of -1 and relying on the fact that the default VLAN ID for an 802.1D bridge will always be 0.</description>

An attempt to set this parameter to one of the REQUIRED (mandatory) values MAY be rejected if (and only if) the requested capability is not available on this WLANConfiguration instance but is available on another WLANConfiguration instance within this Internet Gateway Device. For example, only basic 802.11 might be supported by one virtual AP, and only WPA might be supported by another virtual AP.
A value of {{enum|None}} means that no capabilities are currently enabled on the access point and that no stations will be able to associate with it.  {{enum}}
{{enum|11i}} SHOULD be taken to refer to both the 802.11i specification and to the WPA2 specification (any WPA2-certified device will implement all mandatory parts of the 802.11i standard).
The OBSOLETED values are those for Basic + WPA/WPA2  mixed modes, which are not permitted by the WPA specifications.</description>

        <description action="replace">The external port (or the first port of a range of external ports) that the NAT gateway would listen on for connection requests to a corresponding {{param|InternalPort}}. Inbound packets to this external port on the WAN interface SHOULD be forwarded to {{param|InternalClient}} on the {{param|InternalPort}}.
A value of zero (0) represents a "wildcard".  If this value is a wildcard, connection request on all external ports (that are not otherwise mapped) will be forwarded to {{param|InternalClient}}.  In the wildcard case, the value(s) of {{param|InternalPort}} on {{param|InternalClient}} are ignored.
When wildcard values are used for {{param|RemoteHost}} and/or {{param}}, the following precedence order applies (with the highest precedence listed first):
# Explicit {{param|RemoteHost}}, explicit {{param}}
# Explicit {{param|RemoteHost}}, wildcard {{param}}
# Wildcard {{param|RemoteHost}}, explicit {{param}}
# Wildcard {{param|RemoteHost}}, wildcard {{param}}
If an incoming packet matches the criteria associated with more than one entry in this table, the CPE MUST apply the port mapping associated with the highest precedence entry.
At most one entry in this table can exist with all of the same values for {{param|RemoteHost}}, {{param}}, and {{param|PortMappingProtocol}}.</description>

        <description>Indicates the last port of the external port range that starts with {{param|ExternalPort}}.
If an external port range is specified, then the behavior described for {{param|ExternalPort}} applies to all ports within the range.
A value of zero (0) indicates that no external port range is specified, i.e. that the range consists only of {{param|ExternalPort}}.
If {{param|ExternalPort}} is zero (wildcard), the value of this parameter MUST be ignored.
If specified, the value of this parameter MUST be greater than or equal to the value of {{param|ExternalPort}}.</description>
